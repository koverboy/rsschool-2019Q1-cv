## About Me

I am a junior Javascript developer who lives in [Minsk, Belarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk).

I have started playing with programming since three years ago and I have played with some languages: C/C++, C#, Delphi.

One day I found out about Javascript and I decided to become *a javascript developer*. Nowadays I study IT by myself and at  Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics.

I want  to spent my free time into something useful that can bring me some money and experience.
